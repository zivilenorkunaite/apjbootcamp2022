# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We will now make use of our learnings from our exploratory analysis and build our feature engineering pipeline. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We will address a typical data science workflow which can include addressing missing values, scaling, discretization, encoding categorical features, etc. We will also make use of specific business knowledge to create potentially predictive features.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run "./Utils/Fetch_User_Metadata"

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Retrieve the experiment data from our database
spark.sql(f"USE {DATABASE_NAME}")
data = spark.table("phytochemicals_quality")

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,We can use our familiar pandas commands for data science (without sacrificing scalability)
import pyspark.pandas as ps
raw_data = data.pandas_api()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## We can create a new feature from the pH value
# MAGIC From chemistry, we know that pH approximates the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. We are going to use this information to include a new (potentially predictive) feature into our model: 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$\\text{pH} = - \\text{log}_{10} ( h_{\\text{concentration}} )$$
# MAGIC $$ \Rightarrow h_{\\text{concentration}} = 1/10^{\\text{pH}} $$

# COMMAND ----------

raw_data = raw_data.assign(h_concentration=lambda x: 1/(10**x["pH"]))

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,We now look at the distribution of our newly calculated feature - looks good!
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.set_context("paper", font_scale=1.8)
sns.displot(raw_data["h_concentration"].to_numpy())
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.xlabel("hydrogen concentration (moles)")
plt.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Our chemists also tell us that the ratio of acidity to sugar may be a useful predictor of quality
raw_data = raw_data.assign(acidity_ratio=lambda x: x["citric_acid"]/x["residual_sugar"])
sns.displot(raw_data["acidity_ratio"].to_numpy())
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.xlabel("Acidity ratio (no units)")
plt.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,This distribution is quite skewed so we apply a log transformation - looks much better!
import numpy as np

raw_data = raw_data.assign(acidity_ratio=lambda x: np.log(x["citric_acid"]/x["residual_sugar"]))
sns.displot(raw_data["acidity_ratio"].to_numpy())

plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.xlabel("Acidity ratio (no units)")
plt.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md-sandbox
# MAGIC # Register Features into the Feature Store 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We now register our features into the feature store so others in APJuice can reuse our features for other experiments! The feature store will also make inference easier as the Delta table will record our transformations and reapply these during inference. This applies to both batch and streaming inference. Orange (üçä) you glad you chose Delta!
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A centralised feature store also allows for discoverability and reusability of our feature accross our organization, increasing team efficiency of data scientists. The feature store can bring traceability and governance in your deployments, knowing which model is dependent of which set of features.

# MAGIC Once our features are ready, we'll save them in Databricks Feature Store. Under the hood, features store are backed by a Delta Lake table.
